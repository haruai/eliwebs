		<h1>Hi, my love</h1>
		<p>To the love of my life, 

			Every day is a blessing to me, and every time that i am with you, it makes me feel like the luckiest person to be loved by someone like you. From the moment i wake up and sleep at night, my heart is at ease.</p>
			
			<p>Your past doesnt bother me, it has made the person you are today. What matters is the present that you have me, spending your time with me, and loving me with all your heart. </p>
			
			<p>We do not know what future holds, but whatever happens, i will be always and forever grateful that i have been part of your life. I will forever cherish these moments, and i will love you till my last breath.</p>
			
			Yours truly,
			Your beloved
